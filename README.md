Lambent
-------

Lambent is a very simple program for automatically adjusting the colour of an RGB
keyboard backlight in response to some other input. Currently the only option is
to base it on the battery level.

This is mostly an exercise in writing a very slightly non-trivial Rust program,
there is no intention of any level of production-readiness or support.
